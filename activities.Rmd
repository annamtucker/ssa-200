### Assessing historic and current conditions  
  
#### Activity 1: Understanding and organizing data inputs  
In this activity we will review how to assess a data set, understand the type of data and potential limitations, and format it for analysis.

#### Activity 2: Interpreting model outputs  
In this activity we look at a variety of model outputs including R output and tables and figures from the literature.

### Predicting future conditions  
  
#### Activity 3: Stochastic projections  
Here you will use a web application (linked below) to project the future state of the Island Mouse under a variety of scenarios. We will practice interpreting stochastic projections and communicating uncertainty to decision makers.

#### Activity 4: Data analysis plan   
For the final activity, you will assess a collection of data sets and develop a holistic analysis plan for this hypothetical SSA, including the type of analysis that should be used and the type of projection model, and describe the outputs you would use in the SSA for this species.

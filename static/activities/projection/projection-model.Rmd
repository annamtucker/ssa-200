##### Island Mouse multistate occupancy model

The Island Mouse (*Zapus islandsonious*) is a species that is adapted to the unique ecology of Darlost’s Island and thrive in mild, warm temperatures and need peaceful quiet beaches for successful breeding.  
   
There are 11 populations of Island Mice across the island, and they fall into three ecoregions: Coastal, Mountains, and Paradise Palms. We developed a multistate model to estimate the resiliency, redundancy, and representation of Island Mice under various future conditions.  
  
The model is based on estimated probabilities of transitioning between a low abundance, high abundance, or extirpated state for each population:   
  
```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}

```
  
  
  
The baseline transition probabilities are:  
  
$$\left[\begin{array}
{ccc}
T^{EE} & T^{LE} & T^{HE} \\
T^{EL} & T^{LL} & T^{HL} \\
T^{EH} & T^{LH} & T^{HH}
\end{array}\right] = 
\left[\begin{array}
{ccc}
0.9±0.05 & 0.3±0.1 & 0.05±0.02 \\
0.1±0.08 & 0.5±0.05 & 0.2±0.04 \\
0 & 0.2±0.09 & 0.75±0.05
\end{array}\right]
 $$
  
Three transition probabilities are strongly associated with **ambient noise level**. $T^{HL}$, $T^{HE}$, and $T^{LE}$ all increased as ambient noise level increased ($\beta$ = 1.5 ± 0.03, p = 0.001). 
  
Two transition probabilities are strongly associated with **annual temperature range**. $T^{HH}$ and $T^{LH}$ both decreased as temperature range increased ($\beta$ = -1.8 ± 0.41, p = 0.0023).
